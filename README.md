First, ensure that you have NodeJS installed.

If not already installed, globally install webpack using npm.
```
npm install webpack --global
```
## Install
To run the code, navigate to the project directory using the command line.
Then run :
```
npm install
```
to grab the dependencies.

## Compile
Next, compile the code by running
```
npm run build
```
Or, if you want to do development, run
```
npm run watch
```
to continuously re-compile code as changes are made.

## Serve
Last but not least, to start the node server, run:
```
npm run serve
```
This will host the app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
